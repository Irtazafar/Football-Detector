# Football Detector
This project leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model to automatically detect and highlight footballs in both images and videos. By integrating computer vision and deep learning, it provides a fast, accurate, and scalable solution for sports analysis, training support, and automated highlight generation.

Image Processing üñºÔ∏è
Upload any football-related image, and the system will detect footballs, mark them with bounding boxes, and save the processed result.

Video Processing üé•
The project also supports full-motion video detection. Each frame is analyzed in real-time, footballs are identified, and the results are re-encoded into a browser-friendly .mp4 format using FFmpeg.
